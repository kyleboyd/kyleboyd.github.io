# Web Typography Guide 101

Web typograpgy has changed the way we desig on the web.  Back in the nineties and early noughties the only way to use the type on your website was to use the typefaces which were supplied on your computer.  The standard players were  Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Impact, Georgia, Trebuchet, Webdings and Verdana etc.  These were known as websafe fonts.

This was ok but it meant your design was very limited and you couldnt use custom typefaces.  So everything began to look the same.

With the introduction of web services which serve many plethra of web fonts to your website.  Adobe Typekit and Google Fonts are two different web font services. This means that the tools use a little CSS wizardry to deliver fonts to web browsers to render the typefaces on your website.

There are a few other web font services out there, but most of them are much smaller than these “big two.” Many of the typography houses offer web fonts for their signature typefaces and do some font retailers.

This is a short tutorial on how to use web typography - for this example we will use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Step 2

Go to Google Fonts and pick your typeface which you want to use.  I went for Kaushan Script.  

Select the font you want. You can have multiple fonts if you want.

Then add it to your site using the seps supplied.  

- Place style sheet link in header
- Add h1 styles to your html page (can be internal or external css)

### Step 3

Thats it.  Once you know look at your page the typeface should be displayed on your page.  You can add more custom fonts to other elements like h2, p and cite.  I added open sans to the cite element.

You can the style this up with regular css.
