## Foundation IxD: Turning Ideas from Paper to Apps

---

### Welcome on the next journey of the Foundation IxD Experience.  


Want to build the next Instagram or Twitter? Interaction Design helps to create the next generation of apps, websites and digital experiences.Interaction design is all around us: it’s in the digital tools we use everyday; it’s on the web, it’s off the web; it’s at the tips of our fingers, it’s in our pockets; in short, it’s everywhere. Interaction design is about shaping digital things for people’s use.The emergence of devices like the iPhone and iPad have – in a very short space of time – revolutionised how we interact with and consume content. Tools like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are changing our behavior. We browse web sites whilst watching television, or standing in a bus queue. Interaction designers shape these experiences.  In the last few years the need for a new kind of designer has emerged, a designer with the skills and thinking required to design for these new platforms, and for platforms that have yet to be conceived.
